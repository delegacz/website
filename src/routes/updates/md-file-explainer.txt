Posts are generated from md files via mdsvex,
Following is the explainer of how to use .md files to generate posts properly
One should use the following layout for the file:
- data header
- content

Data Header: This section of the .md file is mandatory and allows to render entry tile on the front end,
every property is required and some have their caveats following is the explainer of these:

layout: specifies the layout that the entry uses, as of now it's 'updates' if/when more is required this will change
check mdsvex docs to familiarize yourself with the concept is necessary
title: Title of the entry, only used to display it on the entry tile, on /updates page
version: Version of the pickup entry is about/prom, just a string, will be displayed on the entry tile on /updates page
date: Date in format YYYY-MM-DD, used to group entries by date, and sort
categories: Categories that entry belongs to, for now, it is a 1 element array of [updates] that may change in the future, will allow
for filtering in the future if need be
slug: it is important that the name of the file and slug is exactly the same. otherwise, there will be a 404.


Content: You can use markdown as you would normally

Following is a sort template of the .md file

---
layout: updates
title: 'Super fancy Title'
version: '0.1.0H'
date: '2022-03-21'
categories: [updates]
slug: name-of-the-file-is-a-slug
